Alt-Tab Enhanced
================
This is an enhanced Alt-Tab for Cinnamon. Building on the Cinnamon code base, it replaces the built-in "legacy" Alt-Tab, expanding the feature set in many directions for the advanced user while working almost exactly like the built-in "classic" Alt-Tab for casual use. One of the new features is a quick-help screen, activated by pressing F1 with Alt-Tab open. To toggle between multi-workspace mode and single-workspace mode, press F5.

This is a brief list of the most prominent features:
  - Multi-workspace capabilities
    - Optionally shows windows from all workspaces
  - Bigger thumbnails, less wasted space
  - New style: "In-place thumbnails", a mix between in-place preview and thumbnails
  - Choice of screen position
    - Top, center or bottom
  - Multi-monitor support
    - Choice of preferred monitor
      - Primary monitor, secondary monitor, focus monitor, or bottom monitor
    - Option to automatically move all new windows to the preferred monitor
    - Automatically forces "transient" (dialog) windows to open on the same monitor as their parent
    - Honors Cinnamon's "Only use workspaces on primary monitor" setting
  - Direct activation of windows using numeric hotkeys
    - Selected windows can be assigned a number, starting from 1, which can be used as a hotkey (inside Alt-Tab)
  - Extended mouse support
    - Multiple selection of windows with the mouse
  - Context menus for working with windows
    - Minimize/restore windows
    - Move windows from one workspace to another
    - Move windows to the current workspace
    - Move windows to an empty workspace (possibly creating a new, temporary workspace)
    - Make windows show on all workspaces
    - Move windows from one monitor to another
    - Close windows
    - Prune empty, unnamed workspaces
  - Highlights alerting or urgent windows in switcher
  - Optionally uses notifications to bring attention to attention-seeking windows
    - Click on the notification to activate the attention-seeking window
    - Click on the notification's Ignore button to dismiss the notification
  - Many keyboard shortcuts, see help screen
  - Many configuration options

Settings
=============
Alt-Tab Enhanced uses the "applet settings" support that was introduced in Cinnamon 1.8. This means that you can change all settings via Cinnamon Settings, but most of the settings are also changeable for the duration of the current session via the use of hotkeys - consult the Help screen for more information. To save the current configuration permanently, after making temporary changes, just press Shift+F3, or press "Save current configuration" in the Help screen, which also has a button to revert to the saved configuration, in case you have made unwanted changes.

Compatibility
=============

Alt-Tab Enhanced is compatible with Cinnamon from version 1.8 and up.

Installation
=============
Alt-Tab Enhanced is most easily installed online from Cinnamon Settings, Applets. If that kind of installation support is missing, you are most probably running an incompatible Cinnamon version.
