Alt-Tab Enhanced
================
This is an enhanced Alt-Tab for Cinnamon. Building on the Cinnamon code base, it replaces the built-in Alt-Tab, expanding the feature set in many directions for the advanced user while working almost exactly like the built-in Alt-Tab for casual use. One of the features is a quick-help screen, accessed by pressing F1 with Alt-Tab open. To toggle between multi-workspace mode and single-workspace mode, press F5.

This is a brief list of the most prominent features:
  - Multi-workspace capabilities
    - Optionally shows windows from all workspaces
  - Bigger thumbnails, less wasted space
  - Supports most of the built-in Alt-Tab switcher styles
  - New style: "In-place thumbnails", a mix between in-place preview and thumbnails
  - Choice of screen position
    - Top, center or bottom
  - Multi-monitor support
    - Choice of preferred monitor
      - Primary monitor, secondary monitor, focus monitor, or bottom monitor
    - Optionally move all new windows to the preferred monitor
    - Automatically force "transient" (dialog) windows to open on the same monitor as their parent
  - Extended mouse support
  - Context menus for working with windows
    - Minimize/restore windows
    - Move windows from one workspace to another
    - Move windows to the current workspace
    - Move windows to an empty workspace (possibly creating a new, temporary workspace)
    - Move windows from one monitor to another
    - Close windows
    - Prune empty, unnamed workspaces
  - Highlight alerting or urgent windows in switcher
  - Optionally use notifications to bring attention to attention-seeking windows
    - Click on the notification to activate the attention-seeking window
    - Click on the notification's Ignore button to dismiss the notification
  - Many keyboard shortcuts
  - Many configuration options

Settings
=============
Alt-Tab Enhanced is one of the first applets to use the new "applet settings" support that is a new feature of the upcoming Cinnamon 1.8. This means that you can change all settings via Cinnamon Settings, but most of the settings are also changeable for the duration of the current session via the use of hotkeys - consult the help screen for more information. To save the current configuration permanently, after making temporary changes, just press Shift+F10.

Your settings are stored in the ~/.cinnamon/configs/Alt_Tab_Enhanced@autarkper directory.

Compatibility
=============

Alt-Tab Enhanced is compatible with Cinnamon from version 1.7.2 and up.

Installation
=============
Alt-Tab Enhanced is most easily installed from within Cinnamon's Applet Settings dialog. If that kind of installation support is missing you are most probably running an incompatible Cinnamon version.
