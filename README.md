Alt-Tab Enhanced
================
This is an enhanced Alt-Tab for Cinnamon. It replaces the built-in Alt-Tab, expanding the feature set in many directions for the advanced user while working almost exactly like the built-in Alt-Tab for casual use. One of the features is a quick-help screen, accessed by pressing F1 with Alt-Tab open. To toggle between multi-workspace mode and single-workspace mode, press F5.

This is a brief list of the most prominent features:
  - Multi-workspace capabilities
  - Bigger thumbnails
  - Supports most of the built-in Alt-Tab switcher styles
  - Flexible choice of screen position and preferred monitor
  - Extended mouse support
  - Context menus for working with windows
  - Many keyboard shortcuts
  - Many configuration options

Settings
=============
Alt-Tab Enhanced is one of the first applets to use the new "applet settings" support that is a new feature of the upcoming Cinnamon 1.8. This means that you can change all settings via Cinnamon Settings, but most of the settings are also changeable for the duration of the current session via the use of hotkeys - consult the help screen for more information.

Your settings are stored in the ~/.cinnamon/configs/Alt_Tab_Enhanced@autarkper directory.

Compatibility
=============

Alt-Tab Enhanced is compatible with Cinnamon from version 1.7.2 and up.

Installation
=============
Alt-Tab Enhanced is most easily installed from within Cinnamon's Applet Settings dialog. If that kind of installation support is missing you are most probably running an incompatible Cinnamon version.
