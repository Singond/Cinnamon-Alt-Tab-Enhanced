This is an enhanced Alt-Tab for Cinnamon. It replaces the built-in Alt-Tab,
expanding the feature set with multi-workspace capabilities, bigger thumbnails,
flexible choice of screen position and preferred monitor, extended 
mouse support, context menus, more configuration options, and other useful 
features for the advanced user while working almost exactly like the built-in
Alt-Tab for casual use. One of the features is a quick-help screen, accessed
by pressing F1 with Alt-Tab open. To toggle between multi-workspace mode and
single-workspace mode, press F5.

Alt-Tab Enhanced is one of the first applets to use the new "applet settings"
support that is a new feature of the upcoming Cinnamon 1.8. This means that
you can change all settings via Cinnamon Settings, but most of the settings
are also changeable on a temporary basis via the use of hotkeys - consult the help screen
for more information.

Compatibility: From Cinnamon 1.7.2 and up.

One-time installation:
Copy the directory Alt_Tab_Enhanced@autarkper to ~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/

Flexible installation:
Make a soft link from Alt_Tab_Enhanced@autarkper in your git clone to
~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/
You will then have the latest version every time you update your local git branch.

After installation, you will need to enable the applet in Cinnamon Settings,
the Applets tab.

Your settings are stored in
 ~/.cinnamon/configs/Alt_Tab_Enhanced\@autarkper
